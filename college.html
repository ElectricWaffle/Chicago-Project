         <p>The above scatter graph shows a weak positive relationship between average book circulation and average college enrollment rates in each Chicago zip code. The data points are fairly spread out for the most part. The zip codes with the highest reported average ACT scores tend to have the highest average college enrollment rates. There may not be a significant relationship between book circulation and college enrollment rates because by late high school, many students only find time to read their high school course-required books. Thus, book circulation is not a good predictor of college enrollment.

         <p>The above scatter graph shows a weak positive relationship between average book circulation and college enrollment numbers in each Chicago zip code. The data points with relatively low average college enrollment numbers are grouped close together, while the data points with relatively high average college enrollment numbers are grouped further apart. The zip codes with the highest reported average college enrollment numbers all have ACT scores between 15 and 17. There may not be a significant relationship between average book circulation and average college enrollment rates because by late high school, many students only find time to read their high school course-required books. Thus, book circulation is not a good predictor of college enrollment.

         <p>While the zip code with the greatest average book circulation clearly has the highest ACT average and average college admission rate out of the five zip codes with the greatest book circulation, there seems to be no strong correlation between book circulation rates and college enrollment rates. This is especially true given that the average rate for the zip code with the second highest book circulation is almost the same as the average rate for the zip code with the fourth highest book circulation. Moreover, the average rate for the zip code with the fifth highest book circulation is over 5 percentage points higher than the average rate for the zip code with the third highest book circulation rate. There does, however, seem to be somewhat of a correlation between book circulation and ACT scores among the zip codes with the highest average book circulation rates. Zip code 60626, however, does not seem to follow that trend.

         <p>The above bar graph suggests that among the zip codes with the highest average book circulation rates, there is no relationship between book circulation and average college enrollment numbers. While there is a positive trend between book circulation and average college enrollment numbers for the middle three zip codes, the average college enrollment number for the zip code with the highest book circulation is almost the same as the average college enrollment number for the zip code with the fifth highest college enrollment rate. This graph presents the same conclusion regarding ACT scores in these zip codes as the previous one.</p>

         <p>The above graph shows no correlation between average book circulation and average college enrollment rates for the zip codes with the lowest book circulation rates. Predictions based on this graph are not particularly useful given that no college enrollment rate data was available for the zip codes with the two lowest average book circulation rates. Zip code 60660 seems to contradict the general trend of greater average book circulation being associated with higher average ACT scores.</p>

         <p>This graph, like the one before, shows no correlation between average book circulation and average college enrollment. Rather, this bar graph is unimodal, with a roughly similar mean, median, and mode. This graph does not provide any more ACT information for these zip codes with the lowest book circulation rates because the first two zip codes do not have ACT average score information available. </p>
