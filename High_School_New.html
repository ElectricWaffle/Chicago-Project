         <p>Scatter Plot 1 displays high school ACT scores compared to the correlating book circulation data relative to their zip code. While their isn't a clear correlation between the two stats upon first glance, there are some takeaways. For one, the average ACT score is much higher for zip codes with 100,000+ library circulations. Certain zip codes also appear to be statistical outliers, with 60607 and 60610 having drastically higher average ACT scores then the rest. The majority of Chicago schools averaged between 14 and 18 on the ACT and less than 100,000.</p>

         <p>Scatter Plot 2 shows that the majority of Chicago schools graduate between 50-70% of their student body, and in the majority of those zip codes, there were less than 100,000 book circulations that year. Zip code 60625, which had the most library circulations by far was well above the average in graduation rates. Interestingly enough, the highest graduation rate in a zip code was 96% in 60610 which actually had 10k less library circulations than the zip code with the lowest graduation rate, 28% in 60659.</p>

         <p>Bar Graph 1 highlights the two zip codes with the most library circulations as having much higher average ACT scores then the three next highest circulation zip codes. The three zip codes that make up the right side of the graph don't have much difference between their ACT scores and their number of books circulated, which point to a correlation of how an average number of book circulations could mean average ACT scores. This could also point to the idea that library circulations are irrelevant at picking a part which zip codes are more academically inclined, except for in areas where the number of circulations is significantly higher than usual.</p>
         <h1><iframe src="fig10.html"
            height="700" width="1000">
            </iframe></h1>
         <p>Bar Graph 2 shows that the zip codes on the lowest end of the book circulation scale are also on the lower end of the ACT scale. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that book circulations and ACT scores are 1:1. The non-linear nature of the graph suggests that while all the scores are on the lower end of the average, they're not organized by number of circulation. Rather, the general number of circulations in the zip code suggests a generally lower ACT score, but there are likely other factors that contribute to these statistics. </p>

         <p>Bubble Chart 1 displays that the 60605 zip code is far away the one with the most book circulations, so much so that it didn't even appear on other visualizations. This zip code also happens to be top 3 in ACT scores, top 5 in graduation rate, and well above average in college enrollment. Meanwhile, this graph makes the large majority of the other zip codes seem more or less the same, mostly dark blue, clumped together, and roughly the same size indicating, they all share relatively similar number of book circulations, ACT scores, Graduation rate and college enrollment. This also points to the idea that library circulations are more or less unimportant in determining academic performace, except for in areas where the number of books circulated is well above the average.</p>
